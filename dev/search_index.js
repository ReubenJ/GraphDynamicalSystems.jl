You will create branches and push to origin, and you will fetch and update your local main branch from upstream.","category":"section"},{"location":"91-developer/#Linting-and-formatting","page":"Developer documentation","title":"Linting and formatting","text":"Install a plugin on your editor to use EditorConfig. This will ensure that your editor is configured with important formatting settings.\n\nWe use https://pre-commit.com to run the linters and formatters. In particular, the Julia code is formatted using JuliaFormatter.jl, so please install it globally first:\n\njulia> # Press ]\npkg> activate\npkg> add JuliaFormatter\n\nTo install pre-commit, we recommend using pipx as follows:\n\n# Install pipx following the link\npipx install pre-commit\n\nWith pre-commit installed, activate it as a pre-commit hook:\n\npre-commit install\n\nTo run the linting and formatting manually, enter the command below:\n\npre-commit run -a\n\nNow, you can only commit if all the pre-commit tests pass.","category":"section"},{"location":"91-developer/#Testing","page":"Developer documentation","title":"Testing","text":"As with most Julia packages, you can just open Julia in the repository folder, activate the environment, and run test:\n\njulia> # press ]\npkg> activate .\npkg> test\n\nAlternatively, if you have ReTestItems.jl, TestEnv.jl, and Revise.jl installed, you can use the script at test/quick.jl for rapid testing. This allows you to make changes and immediately run the entire test suite with those changes. The upside to this setup is that the tests will fail fast, and if you re-run, the tests that failed on the most recent run will run first. This is great if you're just iterating on one part of the package and trying to get a handful of tests to pass. You won't waste time on waiting for other tests to pass and you don't have to manually select which tests you're actively working on.\n\njulia> include(\"test/quick.jl\")\n\nis all you need to get up and running.
